##Tic-Tac-Toe in Cpp##

This repository contains a simple console-based Tic-Tac-Toe game implemented in C++. Players take turns to make a move, and the game continues until there is a winner or a draw. 
The game board is displayed in the console, and players input their moves by entering numbers 1-9. 
The code uses a 3x3 array to represent the game board and includes functions for displaying the board, handling player turns, checking for win conditions, and determining the end of the game. 
The main function orchestrates the flow of the game.
Additionally, the code includes a command for clearing the console screen, which may need adjustment for Windows users. Have fun playing Tic-Tac-Toe!
